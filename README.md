THIS is how a real developer actually learn to code, gain a lot of confidence and there are many things that I still don't know... but happy to learn about, although I still cann't apply them on my own but as I move foreword, gonna learn a lot.

Holy fk, Images didn't work when I puush them manually one by one but, in Netlify it worked... cause I push the whole "Images" folder, and because of the images path name start with /images/... so yeah........ now I exactly know how Netlify works, Awesome.
